| Full test suite | **171/171** |
| Real-account `e2e_all.py` (revision 98) | **36/36** |
| Real-account `e2e_extra.py` (revision 98) | **11/11** |
| Retention live suite (revision 98) | **40/40** |
| Bench p95 (in-memory, 100 ops) | open-link 1.38 ms, sender-message 1.48 ms, mode-delivery 2.66 ms |
| Bench SQL/op | 10.0 / 13.12 / 23.0 |

## Changes in this branch

1. **Named key domains** — content, identity/routing, action. `keyring.js`
   validates each domain and falls back to the old single-key secret so an
   older deployment still boots. The real `secret.js` was migrated with
   `tools/gen-secret.mjs`: content version 2 preserved; identity/action version
   1 added.
2. **Installation salt migrated lazily** — old `enc:` rows are decrypted with
   the content key and re-wrapped as `id:` under the identity key. The salt
   value is unchanged, so every existing derived key, block, and link remains
   valid.
3. **Action tokens use the action domain** — reply/read/block buttons are
   sealed and opened with a per-link action key. Old tokens fall back to the
   link data key until their normal TTL. The existing split ciphertext (DB body
   + button suffix) is unchanged.
4. **Reply windows use the action domain** — the short-lived sender target is
   sealed with the action key; old windows fall back to the link data key.
5. **Album pending rows no longer carry a sender hash** — `pending.user_key`
   is now a link/direction batch scope (`msg:<link>` / `oalbum:<link>`), and
   non-album groups use a random group key. Grouped media behavior is
   unchanged; the current update's chat id is used for `copyMessages`.
6. **`/security`** — a RichMessage with expandable sections, added to the
   command menu in English and Persian. `/help` mentions it.
7. **`.env` key generation** — `tools/gen-secret.mjs` reads named key groups
   from `.env` (build time only) or preserves the existing `secret.js`, then
   writes the runtime module. Serverless has no runtime environment variables,
   so `secret.js` remains the deployed artifact.
8. **Security docs** — `docs/security-model.md` states the exact guarantees
   and the block-key limitation.

No schema migration is required for this branch. `tgcloud push` is enough after
the secret is generated; the install-salt re-wrap is lazy.

## Feature-loss check

Kept: replies, read receipts, per-sender block, block-all/unblock, sender
topics, all three modes, forward mode, sender renames, owner renames, memos,
revoke, albums in both directions, retention, help/privacy/about. Added:
`/security`. No command, button, or behavior removed.

## Final results (after this branch)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Syntax check | 38 JS files + 2 JSON: pass |
| Lint | pass, 0 warnings |
| Full test suite | **178/178** (baseline 171; +5 keyring, +1 `/security`, +1 album identity) |
| Bench n=300, baseline vs secure | open-link p95 2.28 → 2.24 ms; sender-message 2.21 → 2.27 ms; mode-delivery 4.01 → 4.01 ms; owner-start 0.68 → 0.80 ms |
| SQL per op, baseline vs secure | 10.09 → 10.07; 13.09 → 13.06; 23 → 23 |
| API per op | unchanged |
| Real-account `e2e_all.py` | pending deploy |
| Real-account `e2e_extra.py` | pending deploy |
| Retention live suite | pending deploy; retention code unchanged |

Kept: replies, read receipts, per-sender block, block-all/unblock, sender
topics, all three modes, forward mode, sender renames, owner renames, memos,
revoke, albums in both directions, retention, help/privacy/about. Added:
`/security`. No command, button, or behavior removed.

The SQL and API counts are unchanged on every measured path. The small p95
differences are run-to-run noise; the only new cryptographic work is one
per-link HMAC when an action button is created or opened, and one random batch
key for a non-album sender message. Neither is on the delivered-message path
in a way that changes the query count.

## Deploy order for the branch

1. `node tools/gen-secret.mjs` (or fill `.env` first and run it).
2. Confirm `secret.js` exports the three named groups and versions.
3. `tgcloud push`.
4. `tgcloud status` and `tgcloud webhook`.
5. Run the two real-account suites and the retention suite.

Do not deploy a secret that reuses one key across domains; the generator
validates and preserves existing groups.
